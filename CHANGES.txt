Changelog for isotoma.buildout.autodevelop
==========================================

0.0.17 (2013-01-07)
-------------------

- Fix to work when setuptools is only available in bootstrapped environment.
  This happens when using python2.7 on lucid with deadsnakes repo without
  distribute package. This release lets it import the setuptools that you
  bootstrapped into your eggs-directory.


0.0.16 (2012-12-31)
-------------------

- We do not autodevelop any "parts" directorys which means we need a list of
  part names to concatenate with the value of ``buildout:parts-directory``.
  Previously, this list was determined by evaluating ``${buildout:parts}``,
  however that didn't include parts that are pulled in automatically when
  referred to by other parts. Instead, we now get a list of part names by
  inspecting ``buildout.keys()``, filtered down to which of those parts have an
  assigned ``recipe``.


0.0.15 (2012-03-01)
-------------------

- Set ${autodevelop:developed} to '' if not using autodevelop (i.e. mode = off)
